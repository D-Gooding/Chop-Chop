# Chop Chop!

## Description  

This project is a proof of concept for a cooking assistant which uses machine learning to analyse video streams of cooking in real time. The idea is to progress a recipe once the step has been completed and recognised by the AI model. 

This idea could be extended into a cooking coach, or a kitchen safety device for more complicated recipes.
